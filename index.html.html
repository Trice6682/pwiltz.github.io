		<h1> Introducing Medical Technologists </h1>
		<p>
		A medical technologist (MTs) is a healthcare professional who performs sample testing on blood, bodily fluids, and<br>tissues to aid in patient diagnosis, treatment, and disease prevention.
MTs operate a variety of laboratory equipment<br>and analyzers, follow strict regulatory protocols, and interpret data with precision. Some MTs are considered <br> "generalists" which means they work every department in the lab; others are considered "specialists" in which they<br>only work one lab department. Laboratory departments include:hematology, microbiology, immunology, flow cyto<br>metry, blood bank, urinalysis, and clinical chemistry. Relatively, MTs must be able to troubleshoot equipment mal<br>functions, identify abnormalities in test results, and collaborate with healthcare professionals to ensure patient care.

		<h2> Required MT Education </h2>
		<p>
		To become a Medical Technologist, one typically needs a bachelor's degree in medical laboratory science or clinical<br>laboratory science. This undergraduate program usually includes coursework in biology, chemistry, microbiology, and<br>other life sciences, along with hands-on laboratory training. After completing their education, aspiring medical techno-<br>logists often need to obtain certification. Certification requirements vary by state and employer but typically involve<br>passing a national certification exam offered by organizations such as the American Society for Clinical Pathology<BR> (ASCP), the American Medical Technologists (AMT), or the National Credentialing Agency (NCA).<br> <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/clinical-laboratory-technologists-and-technicians.htm"> Go to US Bureau of Labor Statistics to learn more about Medical Technologists.
